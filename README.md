In this project, we have created a playful rocket
launch simulation with a simplified Russian Proton rocket. Users
trigger stage separations and boosters using the space bar. The
rocket progresses through four stages, discarding boosters until
the payload reaches orbit. Mistimed separations result in crashes.
The simulation balances realism with tweaks for a 5-minute
presentation, such as accelerated physics and a quicker sky
transition. Users can interact using the space bar and control
a camera that pans and zooms for different rocket perspectives.
